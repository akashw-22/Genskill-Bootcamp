[Verse 1: Quavo]
Take my shoes and walk a mile
Somethin' that you can't do (woo, hey)
Big talks of the town, big boy gang moves (gang moves)
I like to walk around with my chain loose (chain, chain)
She just bought a new ass but got the same boobs (same boobs)
Whippin' up dope, scientist (whip it up, whip it up)
(Cook it up, cook it up) (skrrt skrrt)
That's my sauce, where you find it?
(That's my sauce) (Look it up, look it up, find it)
Addin' up checks, no minus
(Add it up, add it up, add it up, add it up, yeah)
Get your respect in diamonds (ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice)
I bought a plain Jane Rollie
These niggas bought they fame (woo)
I think my back got scoliosis 'cause I swerve the lane (skrrt)
Heard you signed your life, for that brand new chain (I heard) Think it came with stripes, but you ain't straight with the gang (gang, gang)


[Chorus: Quavo]
Walk it, like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it, like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it, like I talk it (woo)
Walk it, like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it, like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it)
Walk it, like I talk it (let's go)
Walk it, like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it, like I talk it (woop)
Walk it, like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (hey)
Walk it, like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it, like I talk it (yeah)


[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayy, I gotta stay in my zone
Say that we been beefing, dog, but you on your own
First night, she gon' let me fuck 'cause we grown
I hit her, gave her back to the city, she home (she at home now)
That was that
So I can't be beefing with no wack nigga, got no backbone
Heard you living in a mansion in all your raps though
But your shit look like the trap on this Google Maps, though
(brrr)
We been brothers since Versace bando, whoa
Name ringing like a Migo trap phone, whoa
Used to be with Vashtie at Santo's, that's on Tommy Campos
We live like 'Sopranos', and I-


[Chorus: Quavo]
Walk it, like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it, like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it, like I talk it (woo)
Walk it, like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it, like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it)
Walk it, like I talk it (let's go)
Walk it, like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it, like I talk it (woop)
Walk it, like I talk it
Walk it, walk it like I talk it (hey)
Walk it, like I talk it (walk it)
Walk it, like I talk it (yeah)
Woo, woo, woo

[Verse 3: Offset]
Niggas pocket watching (watching)
I want that thot This that 'm√©nage (which one?)
I bought a franchise to double up the profits (franchise)
We make a land slide chopper get the popping (landslide)
Eliott got me rocky
Blow a socket, chicken teriyaki
Take off, rocket keep 'em in pocket
Water gon' lock it
Quadruple the profit (profit)
I walk like I walk (hey)
Talk like I talk (whoa)
What's in my vault? Load of cash and the salts (brrr)
I put a lab in my loft (lab)
She cook up, and jab with the folk (jab)
By the pair, I got karats that choke (by the pair)
By the pair, I got karats each load (by the pair)
Private life, private jets 'round the globe (private life)
Hit a bitch, hit a lick with the 'cho (hey)
