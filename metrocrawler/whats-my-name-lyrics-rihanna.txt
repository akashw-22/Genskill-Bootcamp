	Rihanna - What's My Name Lyrics

Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?


Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
What's my name?
What's my name?


Not everybody knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
Boy, you stay up on it
You got that something that keeps me so off balance
Baby, you're a challenge


Let's explore your talent
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type


Oh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put in work a
Oh oh oh oh... Oh oh oh oh...
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me


Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Oh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over


Looking for a guy to put in work a
Oh oh oh oh... Oh oh oh oh...
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?


What's my name?
What's my name?
Baby, you got me
And ain't no where that I'd be
Than with your arms around me
Back and forth, you rock me, yeah...


So I surrender, to every word you whisper
Every door you enter... I... will let you in
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Oh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over


Looking for a guy to put in work a
Oh oh oh oh... Oh oh oh oh...
You're so amazing, you took the time to figure me out
Thats why you take me, way past the point of turning me on
You 'bout to break me, I swear you got me losing my mind
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?


Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
What's my name?
What's my name?


Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Oh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put in work a
Oh oh oh oh... Oh oh oh oh...
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Oh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put in work a
Oh oh oh oh... Oh oh oh oh...
