		<h1>Monte Carlo Simulation</h1>
		
		<p>The Monte Carlo Simulation uses the ratio of the areas of circle to square to estimate the value of pi. This is done by comparing the ratio of the no of points in a unit circle and in a unit square.
		<br>
		
		The value of pi using the no of points = {{n}} is {{pi}}
